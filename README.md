# Project Summary
### This is a project to build a comprehensive end-to-end DevOps pipeline to support an organization's internal web application, designed to manage and monitor deliveries across the company. The final DevOps pipeline architecture project deliverable is shown below. Also, the steps in the processes involved in the project delivery are itemized below with links to the documents containing the necessary steps in the individual process.

## Project Delivery Process:
### Version control process was embarked by following these [steps #1](https://github.com/HKasie/aks-terraform-main/blob/main/Documentation/Documentation%20-%20version%20control.pdf)

### Next, the application was containerized creating a docker image. The process for creating the docker image entailed the following [steps #2](https://github.com/HKasie/aks-terraform-main/blob/main/Documentation/Documentation%20-%20Docker-containerisation%20.pdf)

### To deploy the containerized application the network services have to be defined and provisioned or setup in Azure using Terraform's infrastructure as code (IaC) to ensure the clusterâ€™s seamless operations and secure communication. Took the following [steps#3](https://github.com/HKasie/aks-terraform-main/blob/main/Documentation/Documentation%20-%20Defining%20network%20services%20with%20IaC.pdf) 

### Implemented the necessary resources using infrastructure as code (IaC) for automating the provisioning of an AKS cluster using these [steps#4](https://github.com/HKasie/aks-terraform-main/blob/main/Documentation/Documentation-%20Defining%20an%20AKS%20cluster%20with%20IaC.pdf).

### Completed the provisioning of the AKS cluster using both the network and aks-cluster modules that were created above by initializing and applying the Terraform project using IaC. Details in [steps#5](https://github.com/HKasie/aks-terraform-main/blob/main/Documentation/Documentation-%20Creating%20an%20AKS%20cluster%20with%20IaC.pdf) 

### Deployed the containerized application to the Kubernetes cluster that has been created. To achieve this, the essential Kubernetes manifest was created and provisioned using these [steps#6](https://github.com/HKasie/aks-terraform-main/blob/main/Documentation/Document%20-%20Kubernetes%20Deployment%20to%20AKS.pdf)

### Configured a Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipeline using Azure DevOps to automate the deployment of the application. The pipeline automates the containerization and deployment process, such that every time a new feature is added to the application, it triggers the automatic build of an updated Docker image, its release to Docker Hub, and the deployment of the updated containers to the Kubernetes cluster. Performed the configurations with these [steps#7](https://github.com/HKasie/aks-terraform-main/blob/main/Documentation/Document%20-%20CI_CD%20pipeline%20with%20Azure%20DevOps.pdf)

### Enabled Container Insights for the AKS cluster to collect real-time in-depth performance and diagnostic data for the efficient monitoring of the application performance and troubleshooting of issues. Took the following [steps#8](https://github.com/HKasie/aks-terraform-main/blob/main/Documentation/Document-%20AKS%20cluster%20monitoring.pdf)
